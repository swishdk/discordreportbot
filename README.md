discord report bot

so this does work, but only if they have actually broken discord tos in their message

ive banned multiple accounts with this, and caused ban waves in servers.

i recommend creating 2 accounts, joining the server and reporting the message breaking tos with 2 of the script open
until it reaches a few hundred thousand each and now it is up to discord to ban them

credits: i did not create this but i have changed it around quite a bit, i would credit whoever made it but i cant remember who it was
